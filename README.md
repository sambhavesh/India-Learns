# IndiaLearnsApplication

DESCRIPTION:


India Learns is a social initiative to provide education to under privileged
children. Based on a personâ€™s innate willingness to contribute towards
welfare of society, the problem of illiteracy can be tackled by creating a
platform where people can contribute their teaching services at
educational centres. These educational centres are provided by the users
and volunteers are consequently assigned subjects and respective daily
timeslots to teach the students.


The application has two activities 
1. Where the center head applies for creating a center.
2. Where the volunteer teachers can search for centres they want to teach in.

With the help of Google Maps APIs and MySQL database we provide all centres available
in a given city for a teacher during his chosen time slot. He is given the opportunity
to select the center of his choice.


WORK FLOW:

The main android application is in the app folder.

5 php files are attached which were run on XAMPP localhost.

createCenterChange.php
teacher_apply.php
db_config.php
db_connect.php
insert_info.php

The database used was MySQL 'indialearns' made in XAMPP.
Thus it works only when the client is connected to the same network as the server/host.
